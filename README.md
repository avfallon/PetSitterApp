The manifest is written to automatically the controller file first, which starts our app

To start the app, you ither have an android device and run it on that connected device, or start the app in android studio and start the emulator by running the app. This will bring you to the login page, where you either create an account or enter the email and password associated with a previously created account. Once logged in, you can create sitting jobs, accept sitting jobs, create new pet profiles and check on the status of any jobs that you have posted
